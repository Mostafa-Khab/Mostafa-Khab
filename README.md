# Mostafa-Khab :smile:
Hello, I'm Mostafa-Khab a high school student who started learning programming since 2023

# First programming language?
My first programming language was C++ which is quite hard (very hard in bad practice to be fair).
And Yes, I really really hate C++ (you will know why at some point).
- I know a little about C in OS APIs like POSIX and WIN32 (not so good, just basic knowledge), both of them is a mess for me (or I'm just dump).
- SFML was my first graphics API, I suffered with it a bit (because I was dump), but now I think it's the best. It's also the motivator behind [gfx-project](https://github.com/Mostafa-Khab/gfx-project.git).
- After SFML I tried D3D9 which is a mess but I think it is even better that OpenGL.

# First Project
My first repo on github is [gfx-project](https://github.com/Mostafa-Khab/gfx-project.git)
which is a library to do graphics more easily with OpenGL.
- It may not have a very good design, but I learned a lot from it :smile:.
- You will still find something interesting in it if you bother by reading its source, that's why this repo is public.

# Used OS
I use Debian 12.

# Typical workflow
- I3 window manager.
- Chromium browser
- Xterm
- Fish shell
- Tmux + Vim
- LaTeX sometimes

you can find configs for those apps in [linux-config](https://github.com/Mostafa-Khab/linux-config.git).

# Used editor
Vim for sure, see my vimrc at [linux-config](https://github.com/Mostafa-Khab/linux-config.git).

# Now
Since I made [gfx-project](https://github.com/Mostafa-Khab/gfx-project.git), I started making some small projects
with help from youtube.
