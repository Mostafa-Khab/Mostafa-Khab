# Mostafa-Khab :smile:
Hello, I'm Mostafa-Khab a high school student who started learning programming since 2023

# First programming language?
My first programming language was C++ which is quite hard (very hard in bad practice to be fair).
And Yes, I really really hate C++ (you will know why at some point).

# First Project
My first repo on github is [gfx-project](https://github.com/Mostafa-Khab/gfx-project.git)
which is a library to do graphics more easily with OpenGL.
- It may not have a very good design, but I learned a lot from it :smile:.
- You will still find something interesting in it if you bother by reading its source, that's why this repo is public.

# Now
Since I made [gfx-project](https://github.com/Mostafa-Khab/gfx-project.git) I started making some small projects
with help from youtube.
